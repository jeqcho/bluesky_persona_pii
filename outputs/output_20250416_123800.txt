If I could speak to billionaires quivering in fear, I would ask: Is the risk of losing some money worth sacrificing your dignity?

If I could speak to Republican politicians, I would ask: Is the risk of losing an election worth being remembered as a coward?<|im_end|>

And I am not an academic or a journalist. I'm just a guy who spent a lot of time online in weird theory circles. 

In my darkest thoughts, if left unchallenged, I worry it ends in exterminist policies, Gaza as general condition outside green zones.

 Hope to god I'm catastrophizing on that one.<|im_end|>

This video shows that we need to get a forensic audit of the 2024 election in the 7 swing states (AZ, NZ, MI, WI, NC, PA, and GA) which would show trump did not legitimately win the election. The first five would be enough to show it.

Tell your neighbors and relatives in these states!<|im_end|>

I've done it for every version since '22 (Cena, Rey, WrestleMania XL, Bloodline).  I want to get the most out of it now instead of paying for the base now and the rest later.  Plus, Bloodline has some extras, so may as well take advantage of it.<|im_end|>

I agree but I will vote for whomever the democratic candidate is over Trump or Vance.Trump said weâ€™d never have to vote again. Unless he dies of natural causes we may not have a fair election.We may vote but it will be like Russia where Putin wins every election. I pray we get house&senate in 2026.<|im_end|>

The main problem of modern politics is how to get the public to notice and respond to events, when our media ecosystem is so fragmented. The solution, we've seen time and again, is CRISIS. Crisis gets everyone paying attention, all at once. stancilculture.substack.com/p/crisis-is-...<|im_end|>
