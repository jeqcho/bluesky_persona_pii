That may be his little army to threaten us but they can be arrested especially if armed and shooting. States have National Guard. Thinking of what could happen helps plan for ways to stop them.<|im_end|>

Even if you’re not sure if you can attend, you can make signs for other people to hold. I design mine in Word, print out the image, and use an overhead projector to trace it out on some chloroplast before coloring it in with Sharpies. My body may be weak, but my signage game is strong. ;)<|im_end|>

I will post every day until the Bucks get active on here. I will get sillier. 

Pie in the BlueSky ideas:
- dunk challenge AJ Green
- taunt mascots from active teams on here to taunt Bango
- get tattooed?
- the worst/best/finest photoshops everyday

Probably that last one is doable<|im_end|>

DMN reporting SSA to withhold full benefits to recover overpayments even though it may not be beneficiaries' fault. Nursing homes/landlords/mortgage co will evict these people w/o their monthly payments. How will these people live w/o paycheck from SSA? Unnecessary cruelty- this is the U.S. today!<|im_end|>
