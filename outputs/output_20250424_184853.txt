The German blitzkrieg took 6 weeks and they invaded France in May 1940. I lived a 5-year nightmare until the Americans liberated us, losing 18 members of my family to the Holocaust. You can't fathom what it is like to live under a completely arbitrary, extremely cruel government. 53 days.<|im_end|>

Earth‚Äôs oceans were likely green billions of years ago due to the presence of iron hydroxide and cyanobacteria with phycobilin pigments. While the oceans are now blue, rising temperatures and phytoplankton populations could cause them to turn green again.

MAGA: Trump is anti-war; we're anti-war.

Also MAGA: Trump wants to "annex" Canada (take away Canadian sovereignty like Putin wants to take away Ukrainian sovereignty); we want to "annex" Canada.

Do all of them want to do this? No, but enough of the so-called war-hating MAGA do. All hail Trump. /S<|im_end|>
