You are a sellout to the republican regime.  I look forward to casting my vote at the next election for someone who will stand up to a fascists regime.  You should move to Florida.  We don’t want you here in Illinois.<|im_end|>

I believe that trans member in congress does prove the whole narrative that trans people lost the dems the election is pure bullshit.

However... she just seems to actively try her best to not use her actual power to defend her community even after proving that we are not a lost political cause.<|im_end|>

I’m sure a bit of military speculation is good for the domestic audience in China as well . . . we can’t liberalise because we may be in an armed conflict soon . . .

I’m no expert on Taiwan but I imagine China wouldn’t really want a boots on ground type thing happening<|im_end|>

Generalizations hurt.   From the outside, delineating who is good and who is bad is  not the work of the oppressed.  Canadians have worked hard to delineate and differentiate from US folks.<|im_end|>
