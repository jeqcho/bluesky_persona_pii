I could describe it as either yellowish light green or greenish yellow. 
Not plain yellow, though.<|im_end|>

You’re forgetting that this will further secure the votes of the hundred or so Americans who share the exact same politics as Liz Cheney.<|im_end|>

“And now he’s saying he’s putting 50% tariffs on Canada unless they agree to become the 51st state,” the journalist continued. “That is insane. There is just no other way of describing it.”<|im_end|>

As a fallback option, maybe. But Gould keeps saying they want members with a sustained history of competing at the highest level. Texas State does not have that history, unfortunately. They’ve been a mediocre Sun Belt team for most of their 13 FBS seasons.<|im_end|>

Writing Tip:
Research the different names for colors. Believe me, they come in handy and dramatically increase the quality of your work. It can be boring to list everything as blue, or green or black, when you could be describing them as aquamarine, jade, or charcoal.

Tesla is under investigation in Canada for processing 8,600 vehicle sales in just three days before a federal EV credit expired.

The company claimed $43 million in credits over those three days. It was a big jump from usual sales volumes.<|im_end|>

Despite trump’s stupid tariffs, my friendly Canadian prescription company still sends me one of my critical medicines for $70/180 pills so I can avoid paying $1400/180 pills through my insurance & pharmaceutical corporations, a difference of $5320/year.
