They want to fingerprint and â€˜registerâ€™ Canadians coming down to the US to avoid the winter cold, the Snowbirds. 

Canada should also â€˜fingerprint and registerâ€™ all Americans in retaliation. 

Thatâ€™s what friends are for. Why we fought side by side. So we could have each otherâ€™s fingerprints.<|im_end|>

Having to put the Canadian and Mexican auto tariffs off for a month, shows how Trump and his advisers havenâ€™t thought through the unintended consequences of their actions.  They are making emotional decisions, without much analysis.  This is the same stupidity they have applied to DOGE.<|im_end|>

Elon is cuttingvthe budgets of government agencies and contractors, EXCEPT HIS. He is giving himself more contracts. That not only screams conflict of interest, and abuse of power, and may make you wonder about fraud too.<|im_end|>

the tariffs, but then also dismissed Canada's commendable and awe inspiring efforts to address each and every falsely based claim Trump had.

The evidence is strong, it's substantial, and it strongly points towards what Justin kindly pointed out..  It was never about fentanyl, nothing Canada could<|im_end|>

Surely. Just as surely as youâ€™re not going to ignore demands for an explanation of your vote to Censure Rep. Al Green -for making the exact same point that you do above.

I must be gullible; I didnâ€™t see what a hypocrite & political opportunist you are.

Now, the entire country sees it.<|im_end|>

If CNN thinks they will win over Trump supporters, they are fucking stupid. All giving Jennings a raise does is alienate liberal viewers. It does not bring in MAGA people who still view CNN as liberal.<|im_end|>

These right-wing media groups like Fox News, Conservative YouTubers and streamers, Facebook, and X ads have huge money backing them to brainwash Americans. Those with money back them because right wingers don't threaten their money. The Left doesn't have that.<|im_end|>
