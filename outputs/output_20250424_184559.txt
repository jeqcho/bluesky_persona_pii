Contracts may not mean much in this day and administration. Trump seems to be fine stiffing #USAID contractors for money they're already owed for work already done<|im_end|>

Please challenge Senator Schumer for his Minority Leader position - the one he abdicated, today, for all intents and purposes.

I know it may seem antithetical, but you would the citizenry squarely behind you.

America needs you and deserves better 

It's still worth fighting to protect and defend.<|im_end|>

“You do?~”

*Sun kept kissing their cheek and neck as he felt his pants slide down further. Maybe he just let Sammi be their influence for the night. He says his last precautions in a more flirty tone as they commence.

“Should I get protection? I uh… may have brought some in my bag…”<|im_end|>

The coping is crazy there. They are trying so hard to defend every single move.
I don't want SS checks to stop, but it may have to happen to open some of these people's eyes.

The new registered agent for Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's company, BC Boost, appears to be a personal injury attorney from Hollywood, Florida.

(Ed. note: among other kinds of cases, such attorneys may represent plaintiffs in product liability suits against companies that sell health supplements.)<|im_end|>

OK, the fact that I haven't even read or seen anything about the symbolism of some wearing pink *automatically* means the message failed.
What was it about?
I'm sorry, the pink pussy hats are long gone.
Maxine and AOC skipped.
Al Green protested bravely.
That's better than placards and pink.
Lame.<|im_end|>

As Linda McQuaig has pointed out, there was a time when Canada possessed a vigorous constellation of publicly-owned corporations. Almost all have been privatized as Canada became seized with Reagan-Thatcher ideology of small government combined with low taxes on the wealthy and corporations.<|im_end|>

There is nothing in the Constitution that guarantees Washington, DC the right to teachers, police, and firefighters. So it’s hard to understand the Left’s hissy fit over the Republican spending bill.
