Russia does not interest them, per se, as a vision for the common good. Putin is their hitman, their junkyard dog that they would feed their enemies to in hopes of weakening liberal democracy so they can raise up their own siloviki.<|im_end|>

"Why to Vote     Non-Voters"

People on our taxpayers' benefits

Non-Voters don't deserve assistance
they have no civic responsibility!?

On the NHS reforms, this is how @stephenkb.bsky.social,  concludes this morning's politics newsletter in the FT. 

It can't be said often enough, in Labour we've finally got a government that is putting effective action, however difficult, ahead of concerns for short-term political gain. 

👏👏👏👏👏<|im_end|>

The way I read it, Canada is selling their own USD-based bonds. They are not selling off US bonds that they already own. I don't understand the bond market at all, but your post seems to imply the latter (a sell off) when it's the former.<|im_end|>

He didn't even flinch from the sparks. That little weapon wasn't a threat to him. In fact, he was thoroughly amused because of his reaction. ❝ Why hit me when it has already been decided? ❞

The chances of killing him to avoid getting wed is zero. He may have manipulated the sect members.

Set yourself a deadline (this week) for generating even a minimal free webpage with your name on it. This is a learning journey. Take your baby steps. This is your writing career starting. It's scary. It may feel hard. You automatically become your own marketer here. #writingcommunity #booksky<|im_end|>

Proud to stand with Canada and Justin Trudeau.

Starlink gives Elon too much control—glad Canada canceled their contract.

Meanwhile, IRS cuts will gut revenue, hurting the working class while the wealthy cheat the system.

When the REVOLUTION begins, will you rise to the moment or stand aside?
