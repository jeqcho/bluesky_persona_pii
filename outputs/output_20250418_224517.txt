“On Thursday, at a news conference, a reporter asked Mr. Trudeau: “Your foreign affairs minister yesterday characterized all this as a psychodrama. How would you characterize it?”

““Thursday,” Mr. Trudeau quipped ruefully.”

How do Dems hope to fundraise with such a flaccid response of leadership? The whole caucus should have walked out when Al Green was expelled. Show some backbone, courage, fight, signs of actual life ….instead of feckless scolding of those who ‘made good trouble’. You’re helping kill our democracy.<|im_end|>

How bored must JK Rowling be that she thinks the perfect moment to reheat her [transphob…] comments is the height of BLM?

This is a good starting point to reflect on how gender critical arguments interact with anti-racist, intersectional and decolonial critiques of Western, white liberal feminism."<|im_end|>

I addressed that. A target for Trump helps him. How many times must I remind people The Financial Times reported every governing party in every developed democracy that had an election lost voter share. Every fucking one. Got it? That's what happened. After the pandemic and pandemic driven inflation<|im_end|>

Mark your calendar! At least the universe will provide us with some galactic pleasures - let's grab them!

"A total lunar eclipse on March 13-14, 2025, will be visible across Earth's night side. See detailed maps of where and when to watch the dramatic 'Blood Moon'.
